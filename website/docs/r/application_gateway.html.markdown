* `name` - (Required) The name of the application gateway. Changing this forces a
  new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to
  create the application gateway.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the application gateway is
  created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
